# UX Persona: The Overwhelmed Collector

## Profile

| | |
|---|---|
| **Name** | Thiago |
| **Role** | Software Developer |
| **Age range** | 30s |
| **Tech comfort** | Expert |

## Behavioral Snapshot

**Saving articles**: Daily, effortless, almost compulsive
**Reading articles**: Rarely, requires activation energy
**Backlog size**: 200+ and growing
**Reading sessions**: 5-20 minutes, often interrupted
**Completion rate**: Low—frequently abandons articles mid-read

## Primary Sources

- Substack newsletters
- Tech blogs
- Long-form essays

## Core Tension

> "I save because I'm curious. I don't read because I'm overwhelmed."

The act of saving feels productive. The backlog feels like a to-do list he's failing at. The browser—where articles live—is enemy territory: one tab leads to another, "just checking" becomes 30 minutes gone.

## Emotional State

- **Guilt** about the growing backlog
- **Overwhelm** when looking at the list
- **Relief** at the idea of declaring bankruptcy
- **Skepticism** that any app will change his behavior

## Goals

| Priority | Goal |
|----------|------|
| **Primary** | Actually read the things I save |
| **Secondary** | Remember and internalize what I read |
| **Aspirational** | Engage deeper—reflect, take notes, discuss with LLM |

## Frustrations

1. **Browser = distraction machine** — Tabs, notifications, "one quick thing" syndrome
2. **Backlog paralysis** — Too many choices, no idea where to start
3. **Reading feels like a chore** — "I should read" instead of "I want to read"
4. **Nothing sticks** — Reads, forgets, wonders why he bothered

## What Would Help

| Feature | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| **Distraction-free reading environment** | Breaks the browser association |
| **Low-friction start** | "Read for 5 min" or "Random article" reduces decision fatigue |
| **Progress tracking** | Validates partial reads; picking up where you left off feels natural |
| **LLM reflection companion** | Sidebar that asks "How does this apply to your work?" — not summaries, but engagement |
| **Fresh start option** | Archive/hide old backlog without guilt |

## Success Metrics (6-month view)

- Reads 2-3 articles per week (vs. 0 now)
- Can recall key ideas from recent reads
- Backlog feels manageable, not oppressive
- Opening the app feels like a break, not a chore

## Design Principles for This User

1. **Reduce friction, not add features** — Every click is a chance to bail
2. **Make partial progress feel valid** — 40% read is better than 0%
3. **Separate "collecting" from "reading"** — Different mental modes
4. **Create ritual, not obligation** — The app should feel like a reading nook, not a task manager
